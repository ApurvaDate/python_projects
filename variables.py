#variables are that store our the information and which we use in our program

#iq is 190

iq = 190
#this is a variable
#once we assign to a variable, we can use it in our program whenever we want
print(iq)
#variables can be name, and giving them a value is binding
# the value gets stores in binary

#variables best practices
# 1) snake_case  #instead of space use _
# 2)lettes, numbers, under_scores
# 3)starts with lowercase and underscores
# 4)case sensitive
# 5)Dont overwrite keywords

#these are things that never change in a program
